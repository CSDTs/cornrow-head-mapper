# cornrow
computer vision and 3D displacment of cornrow patterns

Project founded by NSF and authored by Yifan Xu


An Image Processing Tool for cornrow patterns to allow better displacement behavior on Blender


To test this program, first place an OBJ format 3D model and 2D cornrow pattern which is correctly mapped into base/
** mapping can be viewed in base/mapping.png
** to receive 3D model, please contact author or babbiw2@rpi.edu


To start, run edge.py with a 2D image 

Copy resulting final.png and edge_###.png into base/

Run subdivide.py and include required arguments

Open resulting obj_subdivision_###.obj file in Blender with displace upon final.png to check behavior
