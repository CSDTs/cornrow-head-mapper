An Image Processing Tool for cornrow patterns to allow better displacement behavior on Blender

To test this program, place an OBJ format 3D model and 2D cornrow pattern which is correctly mapped into base/ 

To receive such 3D model if needed, please message author 

To start, run edge.py with a 2D image 

Copy resulting final.png and edge_###.png into base/

Run subdivide.py and include required arguments

Run resulting obj_subdivision_###.obj file on Blender with displace upon final.png to check behavior
